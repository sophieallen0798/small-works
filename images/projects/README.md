# Project Images

Place your project photos in this folder. 

## For the 1202 N 16th St property:

If you have permission to use the Zillow photos, download them and save them here with these names:
- `1202-n-16th-exterior.jpg` - Front exterior shot
- `1202-n-16th-entry.jpg` - Entry/foyer
- `1202-n-16th-living.jpg` - Living room
- `1202-n-16th-kitchen.jpg` - Kitchen
- `1202-n-16th-dining.jpg` - Dining area
- `1202-n-16th-master-bed.jpg` - Master bedroom
- `1202-n-16th-master-bath.jpg` - Master bathroom

Then update the `galleryImages` array in `js/main.js` with the actual file paths.

## Alternative Options:

1. **Take your own photos** - If this is your renovation project, take professional photos
2. **Use stock photos** - For placeholder purposes until you have real photos
3. **Contact the homeowner** - Get permission to use their photos with credit
